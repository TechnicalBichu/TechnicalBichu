The Inevitable Duality: Winners and Losers

For a "winner" to exist, there must inherently be a "loser." This isn't a judgment, but an observation of how many systems, particularly the system we build the competitive ones, are structured. This universe often operates on the law of duality or polarity. Hot implies cold, light implies dark, up implies down, and yes, success often implies a counterpart in failure or non-success. This isn't to say life is a zero-sum game in all aspects, but in defined competitions, one outcome necessitates the other.

Our Fleeting Existence and the Grand Scale

Your reflection on our insignificance is a common existential realization. We are indeed just mere, insignificant creatures that briefly shimmer in the vast, indifferent expanse of the cosmos. Our lives are but a fleeting moment in cosmic time. This perspective can be humbling, even daunting, as it strips away the illusion of our individual centrality.

The Illusion of Materialism and the Nature of Impermanence

The observation that "everything perish, still we run behind materialistic things" is acutely accurate. We chase after possessions, status, and external validation, often forgetting the fundamental truth: everything will soon perish in this world. Nothing is eternal, not even the world itself. Civilizations rise and fall, stars burn out, and even galaxies evolve and merge. This constant flux, this inherent impermanence, is the universe's ultimate law.

The Truth of Impermanence and Short-Lived Happiness

The "short-lived happiness in the long universe" is a powerful way to frame our experiences. Our pursuits, our joys, our sorrows – they are all transient. The comforts and distractions we create are often just to stop us from accepting the truth of this impermanence. But acknowledging this doesn't have to be depressing; it can be liberating. It highlights the preciousness of the present moment and the finite nature of our opportunity to experience it.

Making Our Imprint and Embracing a Meaningful Life

Given this cosmic backdrop, where we can only imprint ourselves for only a short amount of time, the true value lies not in accumulation, but in contribution, growth, and connection. "So let's move to the world's great future" and "Let us be a better version of ourself" are powerful calls to action. If material gains are fleeting, then internal growth, positive impact, and the quality of our experiences become the true treasures.
Choosing to enjoy our short lives with what we have instead of running behind materialism is the ultimate wisdom derived from these profound truths. It's about finding contentment in the present, fostering genuine connections, pursuing meaningful endeavors, and embracing the journey of becoming. In a universe where nothing lasts forever, the meaning we create and the love we share are the most enduring legacies.
